# Myst
Myst is an accountless, temporary, and web-based encrypted messaging application (https://myst.chat).

Myst is built using Django, and this repo contains the static and template files of the app. These
files, verifiable by comparing to source files in browser, prove that each message is encrypted
before being sent to server endpoints. I am happy to share server source code for education or
research (non-commercial) purposes, please contact me at dev@myst.chat for any inquiries.
